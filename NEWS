Version 17
----------

- The board settings have been split into the board theme, the board
  settings and the board "turnedness".  The few board themes are still
  available, but they don't contain the board settings.  The board
  settings include whether tutor mode in enabled, whether the last move
  is shown, and whether the frame is visible.  Whether the board is
  turned is never saved.
- The notation options have been split into the language-specific part,
  and the other settings.  
- "Match mode" is now called "play mode".  Start using
  "babychess --play". 
- In the position editor, the piece to insert on the board can be chosen
  by clicking on the piece image. 
- While dragging a piece, the move name is displayed ni the statusbar. 
- The default board theme is now "Wood". 
- Incomplete support for descriptive notation was dropped. 
- The ECO codes are displayed along with the opening name. 
- In the play window, a custom starting position can be specified. 
- in the play window the clocks are animated to display the side to
  move. 
- don't use GNOME libs. 


Version 16
----------

- There's a manpage for the GUI program "babychess"
- The dialogs are laid out better
- There is now an opening book.  The names of chess openings are
  displayed.  There is an option to show also the subvariation names. 
- The engine plays move from the opening book.  The probability of
  playing a move is proportional to the number of subvariations in the
 opening book.
- The chess notation can be set to the following languages:  Dutch,
  English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian and Turkish 
- Figurine notation is supported via the chess glyphs in Unicode.
  However, the few fonts that were found to contains these glyphs were
  all false:  They display the chess pieces in the same height as a
  lowercase letter, although they should have the same height as an
  uppercase letter.
- Descriptive notation is partially supportted.
- All GUI programs were merged into one executable called "babychess". 
- The other programs have changed names, e.g. "baby_chess_evaluator" is
  now "babychess-evaluator" 
- The game archive editor can sort the games by all seven tags 
- In the game editor, captures can be played in reverse, i.e. by
  dragging the captured piece to the capturing piece. 
- Games against can now be played using "match mode", started with
  "babychess --match"
- Board:  When dragging a piece, the pointer position is slowly adjusted
  to be centered on the piece.
- Board:  Instead of dragging and dropping the pieces, two other methods
  can be used to play moves:  clicking on the two piece and on the
  destination square, and keyboard navigation.
- XBoard engines such as "gnuchess" and "phalanx" are supported. 
- A temporary file is use when saved, which is then renamed.  This
  avoids losing data when the program should crash just after having
  opened the output file.
- In the game editor, the list of legal moves now also displays the
  opening names played by moves.
- More Unicode symbols are used:  the multiplication sign for captures,
  long dashes were appropriate, figurines in the notation, and special
  math symbols to display some annotation glyphs.
- In the gamme editor, one can go forward and backward through the game
  using the mouse wheel.
- The "./configure" script supports the options "--disable-gui" if the
  GUI program "babychess" should not be compiled.  You don't need any of
  Glib, GTK+ or GNOME in this mode.
