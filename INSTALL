Installing BabyChess
====================

Prereqisites
------------

First, make sure all the libraries needed are installed.  On some
operating systems like SuSE, the development files are separated from
the files needed at runtime.  For instance there is a package "libpng"
that must be installed to run programs that use LibPNG and a package
"libpng-devel" to compile such programs.  Often, only the non-devel
packages are installed.  You need the devel packages to compile
BabyChess.  The following libraries are used:  libpng, gtk+ (version >=
2).

You need the GNU C++ compiler (G++).  If it is available under another
name than "g++", please set the variable $CXX accordingly. 

You need the program "make".  Only GNU Make was tested, but no specific
GNU Make features were used.

Your gettext version must support plural forms.  I think only GNU
gettext will work. 


Installing
----------

Use 
    $ ./configure [ --disable-gui ]
    $ make
    $ [ install_dir=/usr/local ] make install

The option --disable-gui excludes the GUI program ("babychess") from
compilation.   Only the command line tools will be compiled.  Note that
./configure was not generated by autoconf. 

"make install" will install BabyChess in /usr if possible, else in your
home directory.  You may overwrite the installation location by
specifying $install_dir.  


Environment variables
---------------------

$CXX
	The C++ compiler.  Defaults to "g++". 	

$CXXFLAGS
	Additional compilation flags for GCC.  Macros that should be
        defined for compilation can be added here using the "-D"
        option to GCC.  Read the GCC manual for compiler flags that
        will optimize the executable for your processor  
	(e.g. -march=athlon-xp -funroll-loops) 
	Macros honored by BabyChess:
	- SETTINGS_DIR_NAME   (default ".babychess")
	  Settings directory in home directory. 

BabyChess needs about 2.3 MB on the disk when installed.
