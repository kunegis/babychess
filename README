	the other programs)

"babychess" has a manpage which gets installed along other files.  All
programs support "--help". 


Requirements
------------

The GUI program needs LibPNG, GTK+ 2.0 and GnomeUI to run.  For a list
of requirements to compile BabyChess, see the file "INSTALL". 


Operating systems
-----------------

This version of BabyChess was mainly developed on SuSE 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.
However, a UTF-8 locale is not mandatory.  Although this version was
intended to also support Solaris, the port was not completed.  Some
facilities for recognizing missing functions in non-GNU C libraries are
present. 

If you have problems compiling or running BabyChess on your platform,
please ask on the mailing list. 

Note:  The text files such as this file are coded in UTF-8.
