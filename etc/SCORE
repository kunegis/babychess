Chess Score Notation
====================

When a chess program analyses a chess position, it calculates a score
of the position.  A score is a number describing the goodness of the
position.  A score of zero means the position is even, i.e. both side
have equal chances to win.  A score greater than zero means the side
to move is better, a negative number means the side not to move is
better. 


The Notation
------------

The score is given in centipawns from the viewpoint of the side that
is to move.  The evaluation is always an integer.  One pawn is worth
100 centipawns.  The value of other pieces and position elements are
chosen by the engine. 

If the position is found to be mate, another notation is used.  If the
position is mate in N moves, then the evaluation is #N.  If the side
to move will be checkmated in N moves after its next move, the
notation is %N.  

In addition to the textual representation, PGN specifies exact numeric
values for the mates.  A score can be represented in an 16 bit signed
integer.  The value corresponds to the score, except for mates.  See
below.  PGN specifies -32767 as the score of a position that is not legal, but
BabyChess uses it for positions that are mate, which PGN doesnâ€™t mention.
