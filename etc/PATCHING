Patching BabyChess
==================

If you modify BabyChess, please send (useful) patches to the mailing
list.   

When you make a patch, duplicate the source directory.  Keep the
original version in order to make the patch.  In this example, assume
the version you will work on is 1.2.3: 

	cp -r babychess-1.2.3 babychess-1.2.3-xyz

"xyz" is the name of the patch.  

Then you can make changes inside "babychess-1.2.3-xyz".  Compile and test as
described in "etc/README".  

When the changes work, clean the patch directory:

	cd babychess-1.2.3-xyz && cook distclean

Check whether there are non-source file like "core" and remove them.      

Then you can create the patch.  Use:

	diff -rcP babychess-1.2.3.xyz babychess-1.2.3-xyz >babychess-1.2.3-xyz.diff

"-P" is a GNU extension and works only with GNU Diff.  You don't need
it if you haven't created new files.  Renaming files won't work. 

Please comment changes.  

To apply a patch, use "patch -c1" inside the BabyChess directory. 

Please send patches to the mailing list. 

Thank you for contributing to the BabyChess project.
