PGN files for testing.

Files come in pairs:   "NAME.pgn" and "NAME.pgn.export".  The first is in
import format, and the second is the same PGN file but in export format.  Doing

       $ babychess-book -a -m NAME.pgn -D

should produce exactly the content of "NAME.pgn.export". 

The *.pgn files are not all in export format and should therefore not be edited
using BabyChess.
