This is an historical archive of the program "BabyChess", which I wrote
approximately between 1999 and 2006, i.e., during my time at TU Berlin.

All files except 'README.2017' and the directory 'screenshots' are
original.    

The program plays chess, and consists of an engine (the part that
calculates moves), and a GUI written in GTK+.  The GUI was quite
advanced for its time, bu the engine was never able to match other
engines of the time such as XBoard, etc.

It uses various GCC extensions of the era and is unlikely to compile
nowadays without modifications.  The build system is custom, even though
is has a './configure' file. 

The original directory was called 'babychess-17.pre.9' to reflect the
version number.  In fact, the version number of the software is *only*
derived from the directory name, so you'll have to rename the directory
or hack the build system if you want to compile it.  The last release
was Version 16, as reflected in the GUI and documentation, but many
features of Version 17 are already implemented.  Note also that the URLs
pointing to my old web pages at TU Berlin are not working anymore.  The
web site used to have screenshots and more material.  

The program is provided "as is" for historical reasons -- I don't it to
run again.  But of course it would be cool if it did.

The software is Free Software, published under the GNU GPL (Version 2),
see the file 'LICENSING'.
